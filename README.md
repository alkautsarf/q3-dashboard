# üåê Q3 Dashboard ‚Äî Production Monorepo

High-performance Ethereum challenges with real contracts, real frontends, and real tests.  
Each challenge is fully documented and production-ready.

**Live App**: https://q3-dashboard-main.vercel.app/

---

## ‚ú® Highlights
- **Challenge 1 ‚Äî Multi-Read Dashboard:** fast portfolio indexing; compares **smart-contract batching vs multicall vs individual** calls (small sets may vary).
- **Challenge 2 ‚Äî Multi-Send Tool:** batch ETH/ERC-20 distribution with **gas break-even** guidance (ETH ‚â• **6** recipients, ERC-20 ‚â• **4**).
- **Challenge 4 ‚Äî Greeting Wall:** gas-lite social contract (Free / ETH / **EIP-2612** / **Permit2**), stores only **hash** on-chain and emits full text via events.

## üß† Architecture Notes (High-Level)
- **C1 (Indexer):** three strategies‚Äî**individual** RPC, **multicall**, **SC batching**. Typically **SC batching > multicall > individual**; for very small token sets, results can vary.
- **C2 (Disperse):** atomic batch transfers with refunds and strict validation. Gas break-even (empirical): **ETH ‚â• 6**, **ERC-20 ‚â• 4** recipients.
- **C4 (Greeting Wall):** **event-first** storage (full text in events; on-chain stores hash); supports **Free / ETH / 2612 / Permit2** with immediate forwarding to `FEE_RECEIVER`.

---

## üß™ Testing Overview
- Foundry test suites per challenge (`solidity/challenge-*/test`).
- Includes **positive**, **negative**, and **fuzz** tests:
  - Invalid signatures (2612 & Permit2), expired deadlines, wrong domain/owner.
  - ETH forwarding success/failure and no retained balances.
  - Invariants: counters update only on success; `lastGreetingHash == keccak256(fullMessage)`.

**Coverage (src only):**
```bash
forge coverage --exclude-tests --nmco script/<CONTRACT_NAME>.s.sol
```

## üì¶ Tech Stack
- Solidity / Foundry (forge-std)
- Next.js + React + TypeScript
- wagmi + viem (wallet/RPC)
- EIP-2612 & Permit2 (approval-less ERC-20 flows)
  
## ‚úÖ Status
- Challenge 1 ‚Äî **Finalized**
- Challenge 2 ‚Äî **Finalized**
- Challenge 3 ‚Äî **Placeholder**
- Challenge 4 ‚Äî **Finalized**

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Known Issues

### Challenge 1 ‚Äî Multi-Read Dashboard
- **Rendering delay is from price fetching, not balance fetching.**  
  - Wallet balances and token amounts are fetched quickly via batching/multicall.  
  - However, prices come from the **CoinGecko API**, which adds latency:  
    1. The frontend collects all unique token addresses.  
    2. It queries CoinGecko‚Äôs API for price data.  
    3. The UI merges price data with balances before rendering the table.  
  - This external API call is the bottleneck ‚Äî especially noticeable when fetching prices for many tokens ‚Äî so table rendering can take a few seconds even though balance fetching is efficient.

---

### Challenge 2 ‚Äî Multi-Send Tool
- **Optimized for multiple recipients, not single transfers.**  
  - The smart contract and UI are built to support dispersing funds across many recipients efficiently.  
  - However, in terms of **UX performance and gas efficiency**, batch transfers are only better at scale:  
    - **ETH transfers:** Batch becomes cheaper at **6 or more** recipients.  
    - **ERC-20 transfers:** Batch becomes cheaper at **4 or more** recipients.  
  - For fewer recipients, the batch path incurs higher overhead than sending individually.  
  - This is expected behavior: batch overhead amortizes as the number of recipients grows.
